## Summary
This will be a [Whitespace](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace) interpreter in Python.
Written as a personal exercise in Python project structures, unit testing, 
and (eventually) (possibly) assembly code generation or JITing.
Python 3.10+ required for the type hints.

## Tests
To run unit tests, from the root folder, run `python -m unittest`
